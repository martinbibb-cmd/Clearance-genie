---

## Radiator Installation Best Practices

**Note:** Radiators don't have strict Building Regulation clearances, but best practices ensure efficiency and safety.

### Wall Clearances

**Recommended:** 50mm from wall

**Purpose:**
- Allow air circulation
- Enable cleaning behind radiator
- Improve heat distribution

**Mounting:**
- Secure brackets to solid wall or studs
- Consider weight of water-filled radiator

### Floor Clearances

**Recommended:** 150mm from floor

**Purpose:**
- Allow airflow underneath
- Enable floor cleaning
- Standard radiator bracket height

**Exception:** Plinth heaters at floor level

### Window/Curtain Clearances

**Recommended:** 100mm from curtains when closed

**Purpose:**
- Fire safety (prevent ignition)
- Efficiency (don't heat curtains)
- Fabric damage prevention

**Best Practice:** Curtains should not touch radiator

### Furniture Clearances

**Recommended:** 150mm minimum from furniture

**Purpose:**
- Heat circulation
- Efficiency
- Prevent furniture damage (wood drying/warping)

**Common Issue:** Sofas pushed against radiators

### Electrical Socket Clearances

**Recommended:** 150mm from sockets

**Purpose:**
- Safety (heat near electricity)
- Socket accessibility
- Prevent cable damage from heat

**Code Requirement:** Sockets should not be above or immediately beside radiators

### Thermostat Placement

**Clearance:** NOT on wall with radiator

**Purpose:**
- Accurate temperature sensing
- Radiator would cause false readings

**Best Practice:** Opposite wall, 1.5m height, away from heat sources

## Hot Water Cylinder Requirements

### Building Regulations Part G3 (Unvented Systems)

**Reference:** Approved Document G - Sanitation, hot water safety and water efficiency

#### Discharge Pipe (D1/D2) Clearances

**Vertical Clearance Above Cylinder:**
- Minimum: 450mm above any surface the discharge pipe terminates
- Purpose: Prevent scalding from discharge

**Terminal Position:**
- Visible location (to show discharge occurring)
- Where discharge can be safely dispersed
- Not where people can be harmed

**Pipe Routing:**
- Continuous fall to discharge point
- No restrictions or valves
- Minimum pipe size as per G3

#### Service Access Clearances

**Around Cylinder:**
- Sides: 150mm minimum
- Purpose: Access to immersion heater, thermostats, pressure relief valves

**Above Cylinder:**
- 450mm minimum
- Purpose: Cylinder removal/replacement, discharge pipe access

**Below Cylinder:**
- 100mm minimum
- Purpose: Pipework connections

#### Specific Component Access

**Temperature & Pressure Relief Valve:**
- Must be accessible for annual testing
- Discharge pipe connection must be serviceable

**Expansion Vessel:**
- If integrated: include in side clearances
- If separate: ensure accessibility

**Immersion Heater:**
- Top or side access required
- Consider removal for servicing

### Vented Cylinder Requirements

**Less Restrictive than Unvented:**
- No discharge pipe requirements (open vent to F&E tank)
- Standard access clearances still apply
- Vent pipe termination over F&E tank

### Airing Cupboard Installations

**Typical Setup:**
- Cylinder in airing cupboard
- Slatted shelves for ventilation
- Access for servicing

**Clearances:**
- Door opening must allow cylinder removal
- Side clearances: 150mm where possible
- Top space for vent/discharge pipes

### Thermal Store Requirements

**Additional Considerations:**
- Larger volumes = more access needed
- Coil servicing access
- Multiple connection points

## Measurement Guidelines

### How to Measure Clearances

#### Linear Measurement (Most Common)

**Horizontal Clearance:**
```
[Flue Terminal] ←---300mm---→ [Window]
```

Measure shortest straight-line distance between flue terminal face and nearest edge of obstacle.

**Vertical Clearance:**
```
       [Window]
          ↓
       300mm
          ↓
    [Flue Terminal]
```

Measure straight-line vertical distance.

#### Diagonal Clearances

**When Required:** If obstacle is diagonally offset

**Method:**
```
[Flue]
   ↘
    ↘ 300mm
     ↘
      [Window Corner]
```

Measure shortest distance (may be diagonal).

**Rule:** Some manufacturers specify horizontal AND vertical clearances must both be met.

### What Counts as the "Obstacle"

**Opening Windows:**
- Opening section only
- Fixed panes treated as non-opening
- Measure to opening edge when open

**Doors:**
- Door when fully open
- Measure to door edge in open position

**Corners:**
- External corners of building
- 90° returns

**Ground:**
- Finished ground level
- Consider snow accumulation in exposed areas
- Paving/decking = finished level

### Common Measurement Errors

#### Error 1: Measuring to Wrong Part

**Wrong:** Measure to window frame
**Right:** Measure to opening part of window

#### Error 2: Not Accounting for Projection

**Flue terminals project from wall:**
- Measure from terminal face, not wall
- Consider plume projection area

#### Error 3: Ignoring 3D Space

**Issue:** Obstacle might be offset in depth

**Solution:** Consider depth/3D positioning
- Window recessed in wall
- Flue projection from wall

#### Error 4: Forgetting Plume Area

**Some manufacturers specify plume zones:**
- Area where flue gases travel
- May extend beyond terminal
- Check MI for plume projections

### Tools for Verification

**On-Site Measurement:**
- Tape measure (primary)
- Laser measure (alternative)
- Photo with scale (Clearance Genie)

**Verification:**
- Cross-check with multiple methods
- Document with photos
- Note in job sheet

**When Permitted:**
- Manufacturer-approved plume management kits
- Specific model allowances in MI
- Never reduce without documented permission

**Documentation Required:**
- Manufacturer authorization

### Exposed Locations

**Wind Considerations:**
- Increased risk of flue gas blow-back
- May require additional clearances
- Consider local weather patterns

**Scottish Highlands:**
- Exposed sites may need special terminals
- Increased clearances recommended

### Listed Buildings

**Additional Requirements:**
- Conservation officer approval
- May affect flue positioning
- Balance regulations with aesthetics
- Document all approvals

### Flats/Apartments

**Special Considerations:**
- Balconies treated as accessible areas
- Windows in adjacent flats
- Common areas

## Manufacturer MI Precedence

### General Principle

**When conflict exists:**

1. **Manufacturer's Instructions** (if more stringent)
2. Building Regulations (minimum requirement)
3. Gas Safe standards
4. Industry best practice

### Example Conflict

**Scenario:**
- Building Regs: 300mm from opening window
- Manufacturer MI: 350mm from opening window

**Correct Action:** Follow manufacturer (350mm)

**Rationale:** Manufacturer specs are for that specific appliance

### Always Check Current MI

**MIs Can Change:**
- Product updates
- Safety recalls
- New test data

**Before Installation:**
- Download current MI
- Check issue date
- Save copy with job file

**If in Doubt:**
- Contact manufacturer technical support
- Document response
- Include in job documentation

## Common Non-Compliances

### Top Issues Found

1. **Flue too close to opening window**
   - Most common issue
   - Often customer requests "can we move window?"
   - Solution: Relocate flue or change window to non-opening

2. **Insufficient boiler service access**
   - Tight cupboards
   - Solution: Enlarge cupboard or relocate boiler

3. **Cylinder discharge pipe incorrect**
   - Wrong termination point
   - Insufficient height
   - Solution: Re-route discharge pipe

4. **Radiator blocked by furniture**
   - Customer places sofa against radiator
   - Solution: Education and documentation

### How to Handle Non-Compliance

**Discovery During Survey:**
1. Document current situation (photos)
2. Explain requirements to customer
3. Provide options for compliance
4. Quote for remedial work

**Discovery During Installation:**
1. Stop work
2. Inform customer
3. Do not proceed until resolved
4. Document everything

**Inherited Non-Compliance:**
1. Inform customer in writing
2. Offer remedial quote
3. Not Gas Safe engineer's responsibility to fix (unless doing related work)
4. Document that customer was informed
